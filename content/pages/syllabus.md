The Writing and Communication Center
------------------------------------

[The Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/) offers **_free_** one-on-one professional advice from lecturers who are published writers about all types of academic, creative, and professional writing and about all aspects of oral presentations.

Policy on Plagiarism
--------------------

Plagiarism - the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement - is a serious offense. Students who plagiarize will be liable to receive an F in the subject; and the case will be forwarded to the Office of Student Citizenship. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted and in all oral presentations, including images or texts in other media as well as materials collected online. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available in the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/), and [Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students](http://integrity.mit.edu/).

Policy on Late Submission of Papers / Projects
----------------------------------------------

Unexcused late submissions will incur a penalty of one partial grade step (e.g. from A- to B+) for each day late. Only serious and documented circumstances will be accepted as excuses (e.g. serious matters of health or other personal emergencies).
